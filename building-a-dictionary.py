# Building a dictionary:
# You've been working with separate lists for your recipe ingredients, quantities, and units, but you've realized that dictionaries are a better way to link everything together.

# You'll now start to create a dictionary called recipe that stores each ingredient as a key and its quantity (in grams) as the value. 
# This will make it much easier to scale your recipe for different party sizes later on.

# Instructions:

#01- Create a dictionary called recipe with "olive_oil" as the first key and 30 as its value.
# Add "garlic" as a key with a value of 15.
# Add "tomatoes" with a value of 400.
# Create the recipe dictionary
recipe = {"olive_oil": 30, 
# Add garlic
          "garlic": 15,
# Add tomatoes
          "tomatoes": 400}

print(recipe)

# 02- Add 'basil' as a new key to the recipe dictionary with a value of 20.
# Create the recipe dictionary
recipe = {"olive_oil": 30,
# Add garlic
          "garlic": 15,
# Add tomatoes
          "tomatoes": 400}

# Add basil to the recipe dictionary
recipe["basil"] = 20

print(recipe)
