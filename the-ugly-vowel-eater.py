# Your task here is very special: you must design a vowel eater! Write a program that uses:

# a for loop;
# the concept of conditional execution (if-elif-else)
# the continue statement.
# Your program must:

# ask the user to enter a word;
# use user_word = user_word.upper() to convert the word entered by the user to upper case; we'll talk about string methods and the upper() method very soon – don't worry;
# use conditional execution and the continue statement to "eat" the following vowels A, E, I, O, U from the inputted word;
# print the uneaten letters to the screen, each one of them on a separate line.

# Prompt the user to enter a word
# and assign it to the user_word variable.
user_word = str(input("Type your word: "))
user_word = user_word.upper()
wordcap =''
for letter in user_word:
    print(letter)
    # Complete the body of the for loop.
    if letter == 'A':
        continue
    elif letter == 'E':
        continue
    elif letter == 'I':
        continue
    elif letter == 'O':
        continue
    elif letter == 'U':
        continue
    else:
        wordcap+=letter
    
print(wordcap)
