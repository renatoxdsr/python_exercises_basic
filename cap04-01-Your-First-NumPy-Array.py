#Your First NumPy Array
#You're now going to dive into the world of baseball. Along the way, you'll get comfortable with the basics of numpy, a powerful package to do data science.

#A list baseball has already been defined in the Python script, representing the height of some baseball players in centimeters. Can you add some code to create a numpy array from it?

#Instructions:

#Import the numpy package as np, so that you can refer to numpy with np.
#Use np.array() to create a numpy array from baseball. Name this array np_baseball.
#Print out the type of np_baseball to check that you got it right.

# Import the numpy package as np
import numpy as np;

baseball = [180, 215, 210, 210, 188, 176, 209, 200]

baseball
# Create a numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball= np.array(baseball);


# Print out type of np_baseball
print(type(np_baseball));
